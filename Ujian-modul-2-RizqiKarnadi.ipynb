    "Because I believe that in a span of a year or more there is a specific time (whether it be days, weeks, or months) where flight attendance is in an all time high. Take summer break for example, a holiday like that increases the amount of people going around across the country or even the continent. While yes it is in thousands of days difference, which if we go into more detail estimates around 3 years +. That's why I have another conclusion, as we can see from the data (in the bonus one) the highest common case is property loss and if we take that into consideration, there might be a coordinated time where someone is responsible for this property loss or even a planned fake claim to abuse the system, that of which I do not know, but in a span of years there must be a time where security is in an all time low and it affects this cycle of day difference."

Kennedy International Airport in New York topped the list with 857 paid claims and Los Angeles International was next at 791, that's largely a result of the many millions more passengers' TSA screens there. What makes me curious is the fact that with the data they have before the TSA's security especially in this sector should've improved, but from what we can see they still hold lack of quality in that sector which leads to the people distrusting the TSA, whether it be their low quality services which risks the personal property of the people or the fact that it strengthens the claims to the TSA agents who allegedly stole the items."
